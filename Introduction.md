# machine-learning-models
In the world of big data, I'm exploring information using machine learning. My projects use common algorithms to make sense of the data. Whether predicting outcomes or sorting things into groups, each project shows how powerful these tools can be. Come along as we dive into data, find patterns, and discover the amazing possibilities of advanced analytics.
